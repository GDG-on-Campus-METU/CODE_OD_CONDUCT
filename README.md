# Code of Conduct for Google Developer Groups on Campus METU

**Our Pledge**  
We are committed to providing a harassment-free and inclusive experience for all community members, regardless of gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disabilities, neurodiversity, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, race, age, religion, or any other protected category. We will not tolerate harassment or discrimination in any form.

**Be Excellent to Each Other**  
We aim to create a positive, inclusive, and respectful environment where everyone can contribute freely. Treat everyone with respect, acknowledging that all individuals have the right to participate and enjoy the experience without fear of harassment, discrimination, or microaggressions. Avoid making jokes or statements that demean others, and always consider how your words and actions might make others feel.

**Speak Up if You See or Hear Something**  
Harassment or inappropriate behavior will not be tolerated. You are encouraged to politely bring any discomfort to the attention of the person involved, as they may not realize their actions are harmful. If you witness harassment or feel uncomfortable, please reach out to event staff or community leaders immediately. Appropriate action will be taken, which may include warnings or expulsion from the community or event, without refund where applicable.

**Practice Collaboration and Positivity**  
Our community thrives on creativity and teamwork. Use the principle of “Yes, and” from improv: build on each other’s ideas and create together. Let’s support one another’s growth, celebrate success, and contribute to a collaborative environment that benefits everyone.

**How to Report**
